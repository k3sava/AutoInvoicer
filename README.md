# AutoInvoicer
Create invoices with preset values on a preset interval

This is an idea that came up in a discussion with a fellow remote worker. We usually work as contract employees and have to send our employer invoices every few weeks to get paid. There are a lot of tools that help us create invoices as-needed but none of them automate it to our exact needs.

Say I want to create an invoice for $2000 every 15 days - I want to automate the process so an invoice is created and emailed to me every 15 days - which I can then email to my employer.

There are a few ways we currently do this - using Workflow on iOS, using reminders and such. I want to create a service that does it for users from a web browser. A secondary goal is to improve my coding skills.
